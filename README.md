# Create Even Teams

This is a program created to create balanced teams from people with individual strength (elo).

inputMain.txt is the file where you write people's strength and name, customize it to use with you own data.
map.txt does the mapping between people's strength and elo, so change it to choose the elo of every strength.

## Current state
Every team is composed of 2 players, changing it requires changing the code. 
I may change this later, maybe add the team size on the first or last line of the input file.

The program can do weird things if the number of players is not a multiple of the number of teams, careful.
